## Concluded

- None

_Actually, this class was carried out **several** times, but this git based format started on the second semester of 2021._

# How it works

Each branch name of this repository is in the format `year.semester` and represents an "instance" of this subject that takes place every second semester (e.g. 2020.2 for second semester of 2020, 2021.2 for second semester of 2021).

Tags are used to fix an event during the semester with te projects, e.g. avaliation, presentation, delivery etc

In the beginning of the semester, the students must organize work groups and choose one of the projects available in the current semester branch. 

Each group must create a repository for their project. Every repository must follow the format and organization required.

After creating the project repository, each group must submit a pull request adding their project as a git submodule to this repository in the current `year.semester`

# Helping each other

The GoodRefernces.txt file is meant to be a place where every student may (more of a should ðŸ˜‰) add good, interesting references, findings and any resource tightly or loosely related to the class subject.

## How to add

Each entry **must** have:
- A title (it doesn't need to be the actual title of the resource)
- A link to the resource
- A quick description about it (nothing fancy)
- Why it is interesting to the subject of this class (nothing fancy)
- The name of who added it (I know that the commit has the user name, but let's make it easier ðŸ™‚)

### Formatting:

Examples:

```
Title: the rapidly dwindling sanity of valve programmers as expressed through code comments
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k238XpMMn38
Description: This is a video showing how to compile C only using a rock and two clips
Interesting point: It is really funny and shows that even real products has its problem. It shows that it is important to comment/document the code. 
Who added: Henrique Borges Garcia
```

```
Title: Essentials: Pointer Power! - Computerphile
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5NszbIerYc
Description: Video showing how pointers work
Interesting point: It is very common to program a software for embedded systems in C and C++. Having a good understanding of how pointers work is reeeeally important!
Who added: Henrique Borges Garcia
```

## What can be added?

ANYTHING! Some examples:

- Videos
- Repositories
- Posts (e.g. Medium, Facebook, Instagram, etc)
- Software tools (e.g. compilers, formatters, parsers, extensions, IDE, etc)
- Tutorials (written and/or videos)  
- Forum questions/answers (e.g. StackOverflow, Reddit, etc)
- Literally anything else

EVERYTHING that seems interesting should be added! **_Let's help one another ðŸ™‚_**
